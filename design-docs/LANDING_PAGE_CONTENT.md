```

**Note:** Positioning after packages and process - clients see value first, then learn about who they're booking with

---

### Section 5: Testimonials (Optional but Recommended)
**Purpose:** Social proof

**Content Needed (from friend):**
- Client testimonials/reviews
- Could be from her work readings

**Note:** Can start with placeholder or add later

---

**Purpose:** Address common concerns

**Possible Questions:**
- What if I need to reschedule?

## Content That Needs to Come from Friend

**Required from Friend:**
1. ✅ **About section** - Her story, approach, experience
2. ✅ **Package names, durations, prices** - All package details
3. ✅ **Package descriptions** - What each package includes
4. ✅ **Testimonials** (optional but recommended) - If she has them
5. ✅ **Contact preference** - Email, social media, etc.
6. ✅ **Session format** - Zoom? Phone? Other?

**Can Start Without:**
- Testimonials (can add later)
- FAQ (can build from real questions)
- Detailed "What is tarot" (assume audience knows or brief)

---

## Design Considerations

**Mobile-First:**
- Large, readable text
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Easy scrolling
- Clear section breaks

**Package Section (Critical):**
- Should be prominently placed
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Each package should have obvious "Book" button/link
- Easy to scan and compare

**Flow:**
- Top to bottom: Who → What → How → Packages (CTA)
- Packages are the main conversion point
- Everything else supports the decision to book

---

## Content Hierarchy (Priority Order)

1. **Hero** - First impression
2. **Packages** - Main CTA, immediately after hero for instant engagement
3. **How It Works** - Set expectations, explain process
4. **About** - Build trust after showing value
5. **Testimonials** - Social proof (optional)
6. **Contact/Footer** - Secondary info

**Rationale:** Show value (packages) and process (how it works) first, then build trust (about). Clients see what they're getting before learning who's providing it.
